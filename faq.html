    <h2 class="solution_content_headline">Frequently Asked Questions </h2>
    <p>What equipment do I need to get started?
      
    </p>
    <p><em>As ScanCheX<sup>tm</sup> is a  web-based system, no special equipment is necessary. All that is required is a  computer (for your dashboard), a printer (for code creation) and a smartphone (to  scan) with GPS compatibility (iphone, Android or Blackberry).</em></p>
    <p>What do I download to my computer ?
      
    </p>
    <p><em>As noted above, since this a cloud or web-based system, nothing is required to be download to your local computer system, which means that you can have access anywhere you have a computer and internet connection. It also means that you dont need to worry about backups, files being compromised etc.</em></p>
  <p>How much does this system cost?</p>
      <p><em>ScanCheX<sup>tm</sup> was designed within the “pay as you go” concept; where your monthly fee is based on the number of codes you require, and not the amount of users like most other software packages. Click this link for more information on price packages-----</em></p>
    <p>Can I access the software from another location?
      
    </p>
    <p><em>Yes, you can have access anywhere you have a computer and internet connection.</em></p>
    <p>Can I change the scan schedule or assigned employee at any time?
      
    </p>
    <p><em>Yes you can .. see our <a href="help.pdf" title="veriScaQR Help Manual">help file</a> here for instructions.</em></p>
    <p>How is this different to GPS and other Asset tracking system?    </p>
<p><em>ScanCheX<sup>tm</sup> is not meant to compete with GPS or expensive 'high-end' sophisticated monitoring systems. Usually these systems require expensive & proprietary scanning devices, along with a significant costs in terms of up-front fees for software and training of staff.</em></p>
    <p>What is meant by geo-coded codes?      </p>
    <p><em>ScanCheX<sup>tm</sup> uses QR (quick response technology) codes that when placed at a location the unique longitude / latitude coordinates gives it a fixed position. This assigned code can then be configured and monitored at the discretion of the user.</em></p>
    <p>How many users can I have ?      </p>
    <p><em>Please refer to our prices table here </em></p>
    <p>Can I upgrade/get more codes for my account ?      </p>
    <p><em>Yes you can.  By upgrading your package you automatically increase that amount of codes in your possession and your monthly payment date is now changed to the current plan chosen. 
      
      We suggest that you make the change at your current monthly renewal date as we are unable to rebate or pro-rate past payments. </em></p>
    <p>Can I downgrade the number of codes I have ?</p>
    <p><em> Absolutely !      </em></p>
    <p><em>However, as a word of caution: if you have used all your codes, and you are reducing the total , then you should decide which ones you wanted to have deleted first, and then actually delete them, and then downgrade your plan.</em></p>
    <p><em>We cannot be held responsible for any automatic deletion of assets which you may have assigned to codes.</em></p>
    <p><em> change your plan to a By downgrading your package you automatically decrease the amount of codes you have available, and your monthly payment date is now changed to the current plan chosen. </em></p>
    <p><em>As with the previous question, we again suggest you make the change at your current monthly renewal date, as we are unable to rebate or pro-rate past payments.</em></p>
    <p><em> Example 1:	</em></p>
    <p><em>	If the downgrade is done to a code level where there is excess capacity. </em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Original subscription	: 500 codes </em></li>
      <li><em>Codes currently using	:	227 codes </em></li>
      <li><em>Downgraded to :	250 codes </em></li>
      <li><em>Balance	:	23 codes </em></li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>This example is simple as there still is excess capacity available. This usually happens because user made an oversight in their code estimation. Though this does happen from time to time, our 30 day trial period usually provides enough time to get this oversight corrected sooner than later. </em></p>
    <p><em>Example 2:	</em></p>
    <p><em>If the downgrade is done to a code level where there is no capacity. </em></p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Original subscription	: 500 codes</em></li>
      <li><em> Codes currently using	:	280 codes </em></li>
      <li><em>Downgraded to :	250 codes </em></li>
      <li><em>Balance	:	(30) codes </em></li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>This scenario is a little more complicated as the user will now have to select 30 codes for termination for the new plan to take proper effect. </em></p>
<p>Do you take credit cards ?      </p>
<p><em>Yes, in fact we used highly acclaimed PayPal to handle our subscriptions processing, and you do not need to have a PayPal account. All major credit cards are accepted. For businesses, automatic bank debit / draft is also supported. And once your credit card has a Visa, Mastercard logo, you can pay in your country's currency - PayPal handles all the conversion to US $.</em></p>
<p>How do I contact support ?      </p>
<p><em>Support may be reached by <a href="mailto:support@veriscanqr.com">eMail</a> or by phone between the hour's of 9am to 5pm Eastern Standard time. Our support number is 305.396.1148. </em></p>
<p>Do you have a Help Guide ?</p>
<p><em>Yes.. our<a href="help.pdf" title="veriScaQR Help Manual"> help file</a> may be obtained here - you may download and print for easier use. </em></p>
    <p>Are the Codes encrypted for security ?      </p>
    <p><em>Yes, these codes are  encrypted, and are only accessible from mobile devices that are assigned by  your company</em></p>
    <p>Can I get a custom package for my company ? </p>
    <p><em>Definitely ! We would love the opportunity of speaking with you to configure packages appropriate to your needs. Please call our Sales Department at 888.847.6373 between 10 - 5 pm Mondays to Fridays.</em></p>
